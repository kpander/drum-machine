# Context

Let's see if ChatGPT (as of Mar 26 2023) can build this for us.



# Notes

Many times, ChatGPT would show an updated file. I'd have to ask to display the entire contents of the file. It might/might not. It'd randomly stop, cutting off in the middle of a line or function.
- Happens with js and html.

After an hour...
- it's frustrating
- it adds some functionality, but in the process removes something that it already had
- so I'm constantly reminding it to add back something, which removes/breaks something else
- it has a very short memory it seems

It does provide solutions for very specific things, but it seems like it's really up to me to keep it all together.

It also will add functionality to one area (say html, or css, or js) but forget to add it to another file. Or, it'll remove functionality from js or html, and forget to remove it from the other file.

By 4pm, I have a working version. I had to tweak a tiny bit of CSS. I haven't had to write any HTML or Javascript yet.
